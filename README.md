## Abstract:
Viral infections pose a significant threat to global health, emphasizing the need for accurate and timely prediction. This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for virus prediction, leveraging clinical and biological features to forecast the likelihood of viral infections. Our model, trained on a comprehensive dataset, achieves high accuracy and demonstrates the potential for early detection and prevention. This innovative approach can support clinical decision-making, enhance public health surveillance, and inform personalized treatment strategies.

Keywords: Virus Prediction, Machine Learning, Early Detection, Prevention, Clinical Decision Support, Public Health Surveillance, Personalized Medicine.
